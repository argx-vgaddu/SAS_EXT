# Performance Improvement Suggestions for SAS Dataset Viewer

Based on an analysis of the extension's code, here are some suggestions to improve the performance of the filtering functionality.

## Identified Bottlenecks

1.  **Full Dataset Loading**: The primary bottleneck is that the entire SAS dataset is loaded into memory (`getRawData()`) before any filtering is applied. For large datasets, this is very slow and consumes a lot of memory.

2.  **Repetitive Filtering on Pagination**: When a filter is applied, the filtering logic is re-executed for every page request. This is inefficient, as the set of filtered data does not change between pages. This is why navigating to the next page is slow when a filter is active.

3.  **Client-Side `eval`**: There are traces of client-side filtering using `eval()`. This is not only slow but also a major security risk (Cross-Site Scripting). All filtering should be performed on the more performant and secure backend.

## Recommended Optimizations

To address these bottlenecks, the following changes are recommended:

### 1. Implement a Caching Strategy for Filtered Results

Instead of re-running the filter on every page request, the results of a filter should be cached.

-   **Cache Filtered Indices**: When a `whereClause` is applied for the first time, filter the entire dataset and cache the array of row indices that match the criteria.
-   **Store Cache**: The `EnhancedSASReader` class should maintain a cache that maps a `whereClause` to its resulting array of indices.
-   **Reuse Cache**: For subsequent data requests (like pagination), if the `whereClause` is the same, use the cached indices to fetch the data directly, avoiding the need to re-filter.

**Example Logic:**

```typescript
// In EnhancedSASReader.ts

private filterCache = new Map<string, number[]>();

private async getFilteredIndices(whereClause: string): Promise<number[]> {
    if (this.filterCache.has(whereClause)) {
        return this.filterCache.get(whereClause)!;
    }

    // ... perform filtering logic once ...
    const matchingIndices = /* ... result of filtering ... */;

    this.filterCache.set(whereClause, matchingIndices);
    return matchingIndices;
}
```

### 2. Optimize Data Fetching

The `getData` method should be modified to leverage the cached indices.

-   When a `whereClause` is present, `getData` should first get the cached indices.
-   It should then calculate the slice of indices required for the requested page (`startRow`, `numRows`).
-   Finally, it should fetch only the data for those specific indices from the SAS file reader.

This avoids reading the entire file and iterating through it for every page.

### 3. Centralize and Secure Filtering

-   Ensure all filtering logic resides in `EnhancedSASReader.ts` on the backend.
-   Remove any client-side filtering code from the webview's JavaScript, especially any use of `eval()`. This improves security and performance, as the backend is much faster at processing large amounts of data.

By implementing these changes, the user experience should be significantly improved. The initial filter application will still take time (as it needs to scan the file once), but subsequent pagination will be nearly instantaneous.
